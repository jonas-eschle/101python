    "- Use matplotlib to plot the curve $y= 4+x-0.5x^2$ where $x$ lies in the interval $[-1,5]$.  Follow Example 2 and use $\\texttt{linspace}$ to generate an array of coordinates of points on the curve. The curve should be dashed and shown in green color. The numbers and gridlines should appear at intervals of 1 unit along the $x$-axis and at intervals of 3 units along the $y$-axis. Draw the lines $x=0$, and $y=0$ with black colour and 1 unit width. Add a grid that consists of dashed lines."
